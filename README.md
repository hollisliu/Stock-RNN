# Stock-RNN

This is a personal project that seeks to predict the stock prices of any stock in any exchange for the NEXT trading date using Recurrent neural network.

The machine learning package used is Tensorflow. 

Inspiration for this project is drawn from multiple YouTube videos that I've watched. More detailed references to follow soon.
