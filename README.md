# Stock-RNN

This is a personal project that seeks to predict the stock prices of any stock in any exchange for the NEXT trading date using Recurrent Neural Network.

The machine learning package used is Tensorflow.

The models trained on FANNG stocks performed fairly well on US tech stocks. The model however, lacks accuracy in other stock exchanges.

Inspiration for this project is drawn from Hvass Laboratories YouTube videos and tutorials from https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials
